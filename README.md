# Slash Wallet 

SlashWallet is a digital identity wallet system specifically designed for testing and verification purposes. Its implementation references both the European Union's digital identity wallet standard specifications and Taiwan's digital identity wallet framework. This testing platform is primarily used to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility and security of various digital wallet functions. It is not recommended for use in production environments.

The project is divided into three main components:

- https://wallet.slashlife.ai :: The web-based wallet instance.
- https://issuer.wallet.slashlife.ai :: The web-based issuer instance for issuing personal identity documents, membership cards, and other digital documents, forked from https://issuer.eudiw.dev/.
- https://verifier.wallet.slashlife.ai :: The web-based verifier instance for verifying personal identity documents, membership cards, and other digital documents, forked from https://verifier.eudiw.dev/.
